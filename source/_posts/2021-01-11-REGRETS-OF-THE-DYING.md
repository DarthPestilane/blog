## REGRETS OF THE DYING

For many years I worked in palliative care. My patients were those who had gone home to die.
Some incredibly special times were shared. I was with them for the last three to twelve weeks of their lives.

我从事保守治疗许多年，我的病人都是回到家中逝世的。
我们共度了一些非常特殊的时光，我陪在他们身边，在他们生命最后的3到12周。

People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality.
I learnt never to underestimate someone’s capacity for growth.
Some changes were phenomenal. Each experienced a variety of emotions, as expected, denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually acceptance.
Every single patient found their peace before they departed though, every one of them.

人们在面临固有一死的命运时会有许多觉悟，永远不要低估某人的觉悟能力，这是我领略到的。
有些人的改变是非凡的，他们每个人都体会到了各种各样的情感: 期许，否认，恐惧，愤怒，后悔，跟多的否认，以及最终的接受和释怀。
每位病人在离开之前都找到了自己内心的安详。

When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently,
common themes surfaced again and again. Here are the most common five:

当问到他们有没有什么后悔的事情时，总会谈及些普遍的话题。下面是5个最常见的：

### I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.

我希望我曾拥有勇气去忠于自己地生活，而不是按照别人期望的方式。

This was the most common regret of all.
When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it,
it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled.
Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made.

这是最常提及的一种后悔。当人们意识到自己的生命即将结束时，回顾此生，很容易就看到许多梦想已变得无法实现。
大多数人都没有对梦想的荣誉进行捍卫，然后就得死去，他们心知肚明这是由于自己的选择造成的。

It is very important to try and honour at least some of your dreams along the way.
From the moment that you lose your health, it is too late.
Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer have it.

在人生路上，尝试去捍卫哪怕一丁点自己梦想的荣誉是很重要的。
从你失去健康的那一刻起，就已经太迟了。健康带来的是自由，很少人能意识到这点，直到失去健康。

### I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.

我希望我不曾那么拼命地工作

This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship.
Women also spoke of this regret. But as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners.
All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.

每一位我照顾过的男性患者都会这么说。他们错过了子女的年少时期，错过了另一半的陪伴时光。
女性患者也谈到过这样的后悔，但大多数是老一辈的人，多数女性患者都不用养家糊口。
我所照顾过的所有男性患者都深深地感到后悔，后悔花费了大部分的人生在工作上。

By simplifying your lifestyle and making conscious choices along the way,
it is possible to not need the income that you think you do.
And by creating more space in your life,
you become happier and more open to new opportunities, ones more suited to your new lifestyle.

通过简化生活方式和做出明白的抉择，可能就会发现你并不需要你当时认为需要的收入。
同时，给生活腾出更多的空间，你会感到更加幸福，也更能拥抱新的、更适合你新的生活方式的机遇。

### I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.

我希望我曾拥有勇气来表达我的感受

Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others.
As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming.
Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.

许多人都压抑着自己的感受来和他人和睦相处，结果就是他们过着平庸的生活，无法发挥出自己的全部去才能，许多人还会在痛苦和埋怨中生病。

We cannot control the reactions of others.
However, although people may initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly,
in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier level.
Either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your life. Either way, you win.

我们不能控制别人做出的反应，然而当你开始实话实说后，人们虽然会有对此做出不适的反应，但到最后会建立起一个全新的更健康的人际关系，
如果不是这样，则这个不健康的人际关系就会被剔除。
怎么样你都是赢。

### I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.

我希望我能和朋友们保持联系

Often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down.
Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved.
Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.

他们通常不会真正意识到老朋友的益处，直到等到他们快要面临死的那几周；而且也不一定能联络上这些朋友。
许多人都的生活节奏都太快了，以至于让金贵的友谊一年年渐渐溜走。有很多深深的遗憾都是关于友谊的，他们没有为友谊的维持贡献出足够的时间和努力。
所有人都在临终前想念他们的朋友。

It is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip.
But when you are faced with your approaching death, the physical details of life fall away.
People do want to get their financial affairs in order if possible.
But it is not money or status that holds the true importance for them.
They want to get things in order more for the benefit of those they love.
Usually though, they are too ill and weary to ever manage this task. It all comes down to love and relationships in the end.
That is all that remains in the final weeks, love and relationships.

在忙碌的生活方式中，友谊的流逝是很普遍的。但当你不得不面对自己的死亡时，那些生活中物质的一面会渐渐消模糊。
人们确实希望尽可能地去创造财富，但真正重要的并不是钱或者地位。
他们为了自己的所爱而努力去带来更多的物质，但通常他们都太体弱多病而无法达成这个目标。
所有这一切都归结到爱和关系，这就是在最终的几周时间内剩下的全部内容了。

### I wish that I had let myself be happier.

我希望我曾可以让自己过得更开心一些

This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice.
They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits.
The so-called ‘comfort’ of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives.
Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.

令人惊讶的是，许多患者到最后才意识到开心是一种选择。
他们禁锢在陈旧的方式和习惯中，所谓的舒适感从他们的情感中和物质生活中溢出。
因为害怕改变，他们变得自欺欺人，安于现状。在内心深处，他们渴望在生命中再次适当地欢笑和犯糊涂。

When you are on your deathbed, what others think of you is a long way from your mind.
How wonderful to be able to let go and smile again, long before you are dying.

当你时日已尽，别人怎么看你已经无关紧要了，在死之前能够释怀和再次微笑是多么的美妙啊。

Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose honestly. Choose happiness.

生活是一种选择。这是 **你的** 生活，请清醒地、明智地、诚实地选择。请选择幸福。
